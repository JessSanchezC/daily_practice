Day | Assignment | Description | Required/Optional
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
D1 | Numbers |Write a program that tells you the following:
- Hours in a year. How many hours are in a year?
- Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade?
- Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? (I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.)

D1 | Numbers(2) | Here are some tougher questions:
- How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow?
- How about a 64-bit system?
- Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need Python modules. | Optional
