## Week 1

Day | Assignment | Description | Required/Optional
:------------: | ------------- | ------------- | :-------------:
D1 | Numbers |Write a program that tells you the following:  - Hours in a year. -How many hours are in a year?  - Minutes in a decade. How many minutes are in a decade? - Your age in seconds. How many seconds old are you? (I'm not going to check your answer, so be as accurate—or not—as you want.) - Andreea Visanoiu: I'm 48618000 seconds old hahaha. Calculate @Andreea Visanoiu's age.| Required
D1 | Numbers(2) | Here are some tougher questions: - How many days does it take for a 32-bit system to timeout, if it has a bug with integer overflow? - How about a 64-bit system? - Calculate your age accurately based on your birthday (maybe use time of day e.g. 8:23am if you know it, use 12:00 noon midday) - you will need Python modules. | Optional
D2 | Full name greeting | Write a program that asks for a person’s first name, then middle, and then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name. | Required
D2 | Bigger, better favorite number. | Write a program that asks for a person’s favorite number. Have your program add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.) | Required
